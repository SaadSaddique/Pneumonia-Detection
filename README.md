# 🧠 PneumoScan: Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-rays (Custom CNN + Streamlit)

PneumoScan is a deep learning-based medical imaging tool that detects **pneumonia** from chest X-ray images using a custom-built **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model. It provides a clean and interactive interface for clinicians or researchers to upload X-ray images and get real-time predictions.

## 🚀 Features
- 🧠 Custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- 🖼️ Upload and classify chest X-ray images
- 📊 Real-time prediction with confidence score
- 📺 User-friendly Streamlit Web App Interface
- 🧪 Ideal for clinical demonstrations and academic projects
